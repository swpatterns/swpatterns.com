Cargo Cult Programming gets its name from the Cargo Cults in Melanesia. The concept is simple: the hope that the same approach to a problem might solve an issue within our system without the understanding of both context and language or libraries. 

## Examples

* Copy and paste from StackOverflow without understanding of the code we copied and pasted
* On a business side, hoping that the actions done by someone else without recontextualization can lead to the same results in our case
